# Email Masking Function

This JavaScript function masks the username portion of an email address for privacy. It retains the first and last character of the username and replaces all characters in between with asterisks (`*`).

--Example
const email = "apple.pie@example.com";
console.log(maskEmail(email)); // a*******e@example.com
